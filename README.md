There are 2 classes: NZeroBoardGame and Solver. 

NZeroBoardGame was the game instance itself providing 4 basic methods:
primitive(state)
initial_state
do_move(state, flag)
gen_move(state)

Solver inherits NZeroBoardGame instance and tries to solve the game using methods above.

More detailed docstring is included in hw1_four_coin_solver.py

Peace.
